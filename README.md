# üé∂ Damped Harmonic Oscillator ‚Äì Interactive Colab Demo

This repository accompanies conceptual work on **Fluid‚ÄìStructure Interaction (FSI)** and  
biomechanical modeling of **vocal fold dynamics**, inspired by the *Fetal Cry* project.

The interactive notebook below illustrates how damping, stiffness, and mass influence  
oscillatory motion and energy dissipation ‚Äì fundamental aspects of vibration behavior in  
soft-tissue and airflow coupling systems such as the human larynx.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Open the interactive notebook in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lrhgit/fetalcry/blob/main/Damped_harmonic_oscillator.ipynb)

**How to use**
1. Click the button above to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.  
2. Run all cells (`Runtime ‚Üí Run all`) to initialize sliders and plots.  
3. Explore the effects of mass (m), stiffness (k), and damping (c).  
   - Observe how underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped regimes differ.  
   - Envelopes (dashed lines) show amplitude decay in underdamped oscillations.

## üß© Context

This notebook serves as an educational and exploratory tool for understanding  
simplified one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) dynamics relevant to:
- FSI coupling in soft tissues (e.g., vocal folds or fetal airways)
- Characterization of resonant and dissipative behavior
- Model verification and parameter sensitivity studies
